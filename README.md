# Form to mail component

![form to email](email-picture.png)

This is a simple form to get an email notification. The form basically uses [Web3Form](https://web3forms.com/)'s API to submit the form information to a speciafied email adddress.

I choose Web3Form solution because it gives a certain amount of **Submissions** per month with putting the emial information at risk.
